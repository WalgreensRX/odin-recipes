            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Pasta is the Italian name for Italy's version of a basic foodstuff which is made in many countries by mixing a fine flour of ground grain with water to create a dough and then making into strips, ribbons and other shapes. Usually based on wheat flour, pasta may or may not be dried and it is cooked by boiling in water or stock and served with a dressing and or other ingredients.
